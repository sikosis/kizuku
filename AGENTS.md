# AGENTS.md

## Scope and priorities

- These instructions apply to this directory and its descendants. A more deeply nested `AGENTS.md` may add or override instructions for its subtree.
- Follow explicit user requirements first. Preserve existing behavior unless the task calls for a change.
- Keep this file concise and current. Prefer repository-owned scripts and documentation over duplicating long instructions here.

## Project context

- Project: **kizuku**
- Detected stack: **Haiku OS C17++ CLI **
- No standard build manifest was detected; inspect the repository before choosing commands.
- Before editing, read `README.md`, relevant manifests, nearby tests, and the code being changed.
- Match the surrounding architecture and conventions. Do not introduce a new framework, dependency, or abstraction without a concrete need.
- Your main focus is a helper application that makes or updates scripts with hum code. (https://github.com/sikosis/hum/)

## Safe working practices

- Inspect repository status before changing files. Treat existing uncommitted work as user-owned and do not discard or overwrite it.
- Make the smallest coherent change that solves the request. Avoid unrelated formatting, renames, or cleanup.
- Never edit generated files, vendored dependencies, lockfiles, migrations, or snapshots by hand unless the repository explicitly requires it.
- Do not expose secrets. Never commit credentials, tokens, private keys, local environment files, or production data.
- Ask before destructive or irreversible actions, dependency upgrades with broad impact, data migrations, publishing, deployment, or changing public APIs.

## Build and test

- `Use the repository's documented build command.`
- `Use the repository's documented test and lint commands.`
- Run the narrowest relevant test while iterating, then the full applicable suite before completion.
- Add or update tests for changed behavior, including failure paths and boundary cases. Do not weaken tests just to make them pass.
- Prefer one repository-owned validation or release script for repeatable workflows. Put applicable builds, tests, screenshots, site generation, packaging, checksums, and uploads behind that entry point instead of performing each step manually; publishing still requires explicit approval.
- Report commands actually run and any checks that could not be run. Do not claim success without evidence.

## Coding style

- K&R style for braces (see example below)
- Every function's next line will be "//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//" (no quotes) followed by two newlines.

ie.

bool MyWindow::MyFunction() {
	return true;
}
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//

- Return variable type should be on the same line
- Use Australian English for variables and other names ie. colour, flavour but use color for conventions.
- Favour clear names, small focused units, explicit error handling and simple control flow over cleverness.
- Preserve compatibility with the versions declared by the project. Avoid speculative abstractions and premature optimization.
- Comments should explain intent, constraints or non-obvious tradeoffs—not restate the code.
- Public behaviour and APIs should be documented. Update user-facing documentation when behaviour, configuration or commands change.

## Dependencies and generated artifacts

- Prefer the standard library and existing dependencies. Add a dependency only when its benefit outweighs maintenance, security, size and licensing costs.
- Use the ecosystem's package manager; do not manually copy third-party source into the repository.
- Regenerate derived artifacts with their documented tool and include source changes alongside generated output when the repository tracks both.
- Keep dependency lockfiles when this repository treats them as reproducibility inputs; update them only through the package manager.

## Versioning and releases

- When the version is displayed in text generally it will be prefixed with a small v  ie. v<MAJOR>.<MINOR><PATCH>
- Every time we make a change to the app, that's a patch and so we increment by 0.01
- There will never be a trailing zero on a version number ie. never 0.10 but instead 0.1 (so no zero)
- <PATCH> number will be right after the <MINOR> number with no dot in between
- Use the same version in tags, application metadata, CLI output, package
  recipes, and documentation.
- Treat released versions and published artifacts as immutable. Do **not** delete or replace a previous package to reuse its version; publish a new version instead.
- Deprecate before removing public APIs when practical. Document migrations and breaking changes.
- Update the changelog when one exists and keep release notes focused on user-visible changes.
- Do not tag, publish, deploy or push a release unless the user explicitly requests it and the required checks pass.



## Git and review

- Keep commits focused and describe the reason for the change. Do not rewrite history or force-push unless explicitly requested.
- Review the final diff for accidental changes, debug output, secrets, platform-specific paths and missing tests or documentation.
- In the final handoff, summarise what changed, why, validation performed and any remaining risks or follow-up work.
